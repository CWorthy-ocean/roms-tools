Welcome to the roms-tools documentation!
========================================

**roms-tools** is a python package for creating the input files that are necessary
to run a `ROMS <https://github.com/CESR-lab/ucla-roms>`_.
This includes creating a grid, tidal, boundary, and atmospheric forcings, initial conditions, and more!
This python package is strongly inspired by the `UCLA MATLAB tools <https://github.com/nmolem/ucla-tools/tree/main>`_.
