# ROMS-tools

## Overview

A suite of python tools for setting up a [ROMS](https://github.com/CESR-lab/ucla-roms) simulation.

_Note these tools are for the [Center for Earth Systems Research Group](http://research.atmos.ucla.edu/cesr/) at UCLA's version of ROMS._

## Installation instructions

### Install via pip

```bash
pip install roms-tools
```

### Install from GitHub

ROMS-tools is under active development. To obtain the latest development version, you may clone the source repository and install it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CWorthy-ocean/roms-tools.git
cd roms-tools
pip install -e . --no-deps 
```

### Run the tests

Check the installation has worked by running the tests (you will need to also install pytest to run these)
```bash
pytest
```

Dependencies required are xarray, scipy, netcdf4, and pooch, plus matplotlib and cartopy for visualising grids.

ROMS-tools should run on any platform that can install the above dependencies.

You can set up a conda environment with all required dependencies as follows:
```bash
cd roms-tools
conda env create -f ci/environment.yml
conda activate romstools-test
```

## Usage instructions

To set up all the input files for a new ROMS simulation from scratch, follow these steps in order.

### Step 1: Make Grid and Topography

The first step is choosing the domain size, location, resolution, and topography options. Do this by creating an instance of the `Grid` class:

```python
from roms_tools import Grid

grid = Grid(
    nx=100,                     # number of points in the x-direction (not including 2 boundary cells on either end)
    ny=100,                     # number of points in the y-direction (not including 2 boundary cells on either end)
    size_x=1800,                # size of the domain in the x-direction (in km)
    size_y=2400,                # size of the domain in the y-direction (in km)
    center_lon=-21,             # longitude of the center of the domain
    center_lat=61,              # latitude of the center of the domain
    rot=20,                     # rotation of the grid's x-direction from lines of constant longitude, with positive values being a counter-clockwise rotation
    topography_source='etopo5', # data source to use for the topography
    smooth_factor=2,            # smoothing factor used in the global Gaussian smoothing of the topography, default: 2
    hmin=5,                     # minimum ocean depth (in m), default: 5
    rmax=0.2,                   # maximum slope parameter (in m), default: 0.2
)
```

To visualize the grid we have just created, use the `.plot` method:

```python
grid.plot(bathymetry=True)
```

To see the values of the grid variables you can examine the `xarray.Dataset` object returned by the `.ds` property

```python
grid.ds
```
```
<xarray.Dataset>

    h         (eta_rho, xi_rho) float64 2.875e+03 2.875e+03 ... 2.972e+03

    Title:                     ROMS grid. Settings: nx: 100 ny: 100 xsize: 1....
    Date:                      2024-05-14
    Type:                      ROMS grid produced by roms-tools
    Topography source:         etopo5
    Topography modifications:  Global smoothing with factor 2; Minimal depth:...
```

Once we are happy with our grid, we can save it as a netCDF file via the `.save` method:

```python
grid.save('grids/my_new_roms_grid.nc')
```

The basic grid domain is now ready for use by ROMS.
