Welcome to the ROMS-Tools Documentation!
========================================

**ROMS-Tools** is a Python package designed for creating the input files necessary
to run a `ROMS <https://github.com/CESR-lab/ucla-roms>`_ simulation. This tool simplifies the process of generating:

- **Grid**
- **Tidal forcing**
- **Surface forcing**:

  - **Physical forcing**: wind, radiation, etc.
  - **Biogeochemical forcing**: atmospheric pCOâ‚‚, etc.

- **Initial conditions**:

  - **Physical conditions**: temperature, velocities, etc.
  - **Biogeochemical conditions**: alkalinity, etc.

- **Boundary forcing**:

  - **Physical forcing**: temperature, velocities, etc.
  - **Biogeochemical forcing**: alkalinity, etc.

Currently, **ROMS-Tools** does **not** support:

- River forcing
- Nesting

This Python package is inspired by the `UCLA MATLAB tools <https://github.com/nmolem/ucla-tools/tree/main>`_.
