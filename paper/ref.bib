	abstract = {An updated global bathymetry and topography grid is presented using a spatial sampling interval of 15 arc sec. The bathymetry is produced using a combination of shipboard soundings and depths predicted using satellite altimetry. New data consists of {\textgreater}33.6 million multibeam and singlebeam measurements collated by several institutions, namely, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Geoscience Australia, Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping, and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. New altimetry data consists of 48, 14, and 12 months of retracked range measurements from Cryosat-2, SARAL/AltiKa, and Jason-2, respectively. With respect to SRTM15\_PLUS (Olson et al., 2016), the inclusion of these new data results in a ∼1.4-km improvement in the minimum wavelength recovered for sea surface free-air gravity anomalies, a small increase in the accuracy of altimetrically derived predicted depths, and a 1.24\% increase, from 9.60\% to 10.84\%, in the total area of ocean floor that is constrained by shipboard soundings at 15-arc sec resolution. Bathymetric grid cells constrained by satellite altimetry have estimated uncertainties of ±150 m in the deep oceans and ±180 m between coastlines and the continental rise. Onshore, topography data are sourced from previously published digital elevation models, predominately SRTM-CGIAR V4.1 between 60◦N and 60◦S. ArcticDEM is used above 60◦N, while Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica is used below 62◦S. Auxiliary grids illustrating shipboard data coverage, marine free-air gravity anomalies, and vertical gradient gradients are also provided in common data formats.},

abstract = {Abstract Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

	abstract = {A computationally efficient relocatable system for generalized inverse (GI) modeling of barotropic ocean tides is described. The GI penalty functional is minimized using a representer method, which requires repeated solution of the forward and adjoint linearized shallow water equations (SWEs). To make representer computations efficient, the SWEs are solved in the frequency domain by factoring the coefficient matrix for a finite-difference discretization of the second-order wave equation in elevation. Once this matrix is factored representers can be calculated rapidly. By retaining the first-order SWE system (defined in terms of both elevations and currents) in the definition of the discretized GI penalty functional, complete generality in the choice of dynamical error covariances is retained. This allows rational assumptions about errors in the SWE, with soft momentum balance constraints (e.g., to account for inaccurate parameterization of dissipation), but holds mass conservation constraints. While the dynamical calculations involve elevations alone, depth-averaged currents can be directly assimilated into the tidal model with this approach. The efficient representer calculation forms the basis for the Oregon State University (OSU) Tidal Inversion Software (OTIS). OTIS includes software for generating grids, prior model covariances, and boundary conditions; for time stepping the nonlinear shallow water equations to generate a first guess or prior solution; for preliminary processing of TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data; for solution of the GI problem; and for computation of posterior error bars. Approximate GI solution methods, based on using a reduced set of representers, allow very large datasets to be inverted. OTIS regional and local GI tidal modeling (with grids containing up to 105 nodes) require only a few hours on a common desktop workstation. Use of OTIS is illustrated by developing a new regional-scale (1/6°) model of tides in the Indonesian Seas.},

	abstract = {Annual and monthly mean values of continental freshwater discharge into the oceans are estimated at 1° resolution using several methods. The most accurate estimate is based on streamflow data from the world's largest 921 rivers, supplemented with estimates of discharge from unmonitored areas based on the ratios of runoff and drainage area between the unmonitored and monitored regions. Simulations using a river transport model (RTM) forced by a runoff field were used to derive the river mouth outflow from the farthest downstream gauge records. Separate estimates are also made using RTM simulations forced by three different runoff fields: 1) based on observed streamflow and a water balance model, and from estimates of precipitation P minus evaporation E computed as residuals from the atmospheric moisture budget using atmospheric reanalyses from 2) the National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP–NCAR) and 3) the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Compared with previous estimates, improvements are made in extending observed discharge downstream to the river mouth, in accounting for the unmonitored streamflow, in discharging runoff at correct locations, and in providing an annual cycle of continental discharge. The use of river mouth outflow increases the global continental discharge by ∼19\% compared with unadjusted streamflow from the farthest downstream stations. The river-based estimate of global continental discharge presented here is 37 288 ± 662 km3 yr−1, which is ∼7.6\% of global P or 35\% of terrestrial P. While this number is comparable to earlier estimates, its partitioning into individual oceans and its latitudinal distribution differ from earlier studies. The peak discharges into the Arctic, the Pacific, and global oceans occur in June, versus May for the Atlantic and August for the Indian Oceans. Snow accumulation and melt are shown to have large effects on the annual cycle of discharge into all ocean basins except for the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The discharge and its latitudinal distribution implied by the observation-based runoff and the ECMWF reanalysis-based P–E agree well with the river-based estimates, whereas the discharge implied by the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis-based P–E has a negative bias.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to find a combination of optimal numerical algorithms for time-stepping and mode-splitting suitable for a high-resolution, free-surface, terrain-following coordinate oceanic model. Due to mathematical feedback between the baroclinic momentum and tracer equations and, similarly, between the barotropic momentum and continuity equations, it is advantageous to treat both modes so that, after a time step for the momentum equation, the computed velocities participate immediately in the computation of tracers and continuity, and vice versa, rather than advancing all equations for one time step simultaneously. This leads to a new family of time-stepping algorithms that combine forward–backward feedback with the best known synchronous algorithms, allowing an increased time step due to the enhanced internal stability without sacrificing its accuracy. Based on these algorithms we design a split-explicit hydrodynamic kernel for a realistic oceanic model, which addresses multiple numerical issues associated with mode splitting. This kernel utilizes consistent temporal averaging of the barotropic mode via a specially designed filter function to guarantee both exact conservation and constancy preservation properties for tracers and yields more accurate (up to second-order), resolved barotropic processes, while preventing aliasing of unresolved barotropic signals into the slow baroclinic motions. It has a more accurate mode-splitting due to redefined barotropic pressure-gradient terms to account for the local variations in density field, while maintaining the computational efficiency of a split model. It is naturally compatible with a variety of centered and upstream-biased high-order advection algorithms, and helps to mitigate computational cost of expensive physical parameterization of mixing processes and submodels.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the structure and dynamical mechanisms of regional and mesoscale physical variability in the subtropical northeast Pacific Ocean using the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS). The model is configured with a U.S. West Coast domain that spans the California Current System (CCS) with a mesoscale horizontal resolution up to as fine as 3.5 km. Its mean-seasonal forcing is by momentum, heat, and water fluxes at the surface and adaptive nudging to gyre-scale fields at the open water boundaries. Its equilibrium solutions show realistic mean and seasonal states and vigorous mesoscale eddies, fronts, and filaments. The level of eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in the model is comparable to drifter and altimeter estimates in the solutions with sufficiently fine resolution. Because the model lacks nonseasonal transient forcing, the authors conclude that the dominant mesoscale variability in the CCS is intrinsic rather than transiently forced. The primary eddy generation mechanism is the baroclinic instability of upwelling, alongshore currents. There is progressive movement of mean-seasonal currents and eddy energy offshore and downward into the oceanic interior in an annually recurrent cycle. The associated offshore eddy heat fluxes provide the principal balance against nearshore cooling by mean Ekman transport and upwelling. The currents are highly nonuniform along the coast, with important influences by capes and ridges in both maintaining mean standing eddies and launching transient filaments and fronts.},

	abstract = {We study the dynamics of the planktonic ecosystem in the coastal upwelling zone within the California Current System using a three-dimensional (3-D), eddy-resolving circulation model coupled to an ecosystem/biogeochemistry model. The physical model is based on the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS), configured at a resolution of 15km for a domain covering the entire US West Coast, with an embedded child grid covering the central California upwelling region at a resolution of 5km. The model is forced with monthly mean boundary conditions at the open lateral boundaries as well as at the surface. The ecological/biogeochemical model is nitrogen based, includes single classes for phytoplankton and zooplankton, and considers two detrital pools with different sinking speeds. The model also explicitly simulates a variable chlorophyll-to-carbon ratio. Comparisons of model results with either remote sensing observations (AVHRR, SeaWiFS) or in-situ measurements from the CalCOFI program indicate that our model is capable of replicating many of the large-scale, time-averaged features of the coastal upwelling system. An exception is the underestimation of the chlorophyll levels in the northern part of the domain, perhaps because of the lack of short-term variations in the atmospheric forcing. Another shortcoming is that the modeled thermocline is too diffuse, and that the upward slope of the isolines toward the coast is too small. Detailed time-series comparisons with observations from Monterey Bay reveal similar agreements and discrepancies. We attribute the good agreement between the modeled and observed ecological properties in large part to the accuracy of the physical fields. In turn, many of the discrepancies can be traced back to our use of monthly mean forcing. Analysis of the ecosystem structure and dynamics reveal that the magnitude and pattern of phytoplankton biomass in the nearshore region are determined largely by the balance of growth and zooplankton grazing, while in the offshore region, growth is balanced by mortality. The latter appears to be inconsistent with in situ observations and is a result of our consideration of only one zooplankton size class (mesozooplankton), neglecting the importance of microzooplankton grazing in the offshore region. A comparison of the allocation of nitrogen into the different pools of the ecosystem in the 3-D results with those obtained from a box model configuration of the same ecosystem model reveals that only a few components of the ecosystem reach a local steady-state, i.e. where biological sources and sinks balance each other. The balances for the majority of the components are achieved by local biological source and sink terms balancing the net physical divergence, confirming the importance of the 3-D nature of circulation and mixing in a coastal upwelling system.},
