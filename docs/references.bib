	abstract = {The use of σ-coordinate ocean models has historically been considered a disadvantage for large-scale climate studies. The main reason resides in the non-alignment of the vertical coordinate isosurfaces with either geopotential surfaces or isopycnals making it harder to accurately compute the horizontal pressure gradient, advection, and isoneutral tracer diffusion. Moreover, this class of model requires a vertical mixing parameterization robust to large changes in the vertical resolution between shallow and deep areas. In this paper we show that, with some adjustments of the tracer advection, the surface boundary layer parameterization and the vertical grid, a σ-coordinate model can achieve an accurate representation of the oceanic interior and mixed-layer dynamics. To do so, a new way of handling the temporal discretization of the rotated biharmonic operator is used to achieve tracer variance dissipation in an adiabatic and computationally efficient way. Furthermore, a redesign of the K-Profile surface layer Parameterization (KPP) to improve the regularity of the solution and the overall numerical efficiency of the scheme is introduced. To validate the new algorithmic developments, we perform a set of coarse-resolution realistic basin-scale Pacific simulations. Besides improving the conservation of water mass properties, the use of an isoneutral tracer hyperdiffusion is shown to have a negative feedback on the circulation error growth rate, thus significantly reducing the sensitivity of the model solution to the degree of topographic smoothing. The overall validation of our simulations, focusing on the key characteristics of the circulation in the Pacific Ocean, provides some evidence of the efficacy of a terrain-following coordinate for large scale applications.},

	abstract = {Ocean models usually rely on a tracer mixing operator which diffuses along isoneutral directions. This requirement is imposed by the highly adiabatic nature of the oceanic interior, and a numerical simulation needs to respect these small levels of dianeutral mixing to maintain physically realistic results. For non-isopycnic models this is however non-trivial due to the non-alignment of the vertical coordinate isosurfaces with local isoneutral directions, rotated mixing operators must therefore be used. This paper considers the numerical solution of initial boundary value problems for the harmonic (Laplacian) and biharmonic rotated diffusion operators. We provide stability criteria associated with the conventional space–time discretizations of the isoneutral Laplacian operator currently in use in general circulation models. Furthermore, we propose and study possible alternatives to those schemes. A new way to handle the temporal discretization of the rotated biharmonic operator is also introduced. This scheme requires only the resolution of a simple one-dimensional tridiagonal system in the vertical direction to provide the same stability limit of the non-rotated operator. The performance of the various schemes in terms of stability and accuracy is illustrated by idealized numerical experiments of the diffusion of a passive tracer along isoneutral directions.},

The model equations appearing in H2008, Section 2.1 (taken from an earlier article, Haidvogel et al.

	abstract = {We investigate the variations of the ocean CO2 sink during the past three decades using global surface ocean maps of the partial pressure of CO2 reconstructed from observations contained in the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas Version 2. To create these maps, we used the neural network-based data interpolation method of Landschützer et al. (2014) but extended the work in time from 1998 to 2011 to the period from 1982 through 2011. Our results suggest strong decadal variations in the global ocean carbon sink around a long-term increase that corresponds roughly to that expected from the rise in atmospheric CO2. The sink is estimated to have weakened during the 1990s toward a minimum uptake of only −0.8 ± 0.5 Pg C yr−1 in 2000 and thereafter to have strengthened considerably to rates of more than −2.0 ± 0.5 Pg C yr−1. These decadal variations originate mostly from the extratropical oceans, while the tropical regions contribute primarily to interannual variations. Changes in sea surface temperature affecting the solubility of CO2 explain part of these variations, particularly at subtropical latitudes. But most of the higher-latitude changes are attributed to modifications in the surface concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity, induced by decadal variations in atmospheric forcing, with patterns that are reminiscent of those of the Northern and Southern Annular Modes. These decadal variations lead to a substantially smaller cumulative anthropogenic CO2 uptake of the ocean over the 1982 through 2011 period (reduction of 7.5 ± 5.5 Pg C) relative to that derived by the Global Carbon Budget.},

abstract = {Abstract Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

	abstract = {A computationally efficient relocatable system for generalized inverse (GI) modeling of barotropic ocean tides is described. The GI penalty functional is minimized using a representer method, which requires repeated solution of the forward and adjoint linearized shallow water equations (SWEs). To make representer computations efficient, the SWEs are solved in the frequency domain by factoring the coefficient matrix for a finite-difference discretization of the second-order wave equation in elevation. Once this matrix is factored representers can be calculated rapidly. By retaining the first-order SWE system (defined in terms of both elevations and currents) in the definition of the discretized GI penalty functional, complete generality in the choice of dynamical error covariances is retained. This allows rational assumptions about errors in the SWE, with soft momentum balance constraints (e.g., to account for inaccurate parameterization of dissipation), but holds mass conservation constraints. While the dynamical calculations involve elevations alone, depth-averaged currents can be directly assimilated into the tidal model with this approach. The efficient representer calculation forms the basis for the Oregon State University (OSU) Tidal Inversion Software (OTIS). OTIS includes software for generating grids, prior model covariances, and boundary conditions; for time stepping the nonlinear shallow water equations to generate a first guess or prior solution; for preliminary processing of TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data; for solution of the GI problem; and for computation of posterior error bars. Approximate GI solution methods, based on using a reduced set of representers, allow very large datasets to be inverted. OTIS regional and local GI tidal modeling (with grids containing up to 105 nodes) require only a few hours on a common desktop workstation. Use of OTIS is illustrated by developing a new regional-scale (1/6°) model of tides in the Indonesian Seas.},

	abstract = {Annual and monthly mean values of continental freshwater discharge into the oceans are estimated at 1° resolution using several methods. The most accurate estimate is based on streamflow data from the world's largest 921 rivers, supplemented with estimates of discharge from unmonitored areas based on the ratios of runoff and drainage area between the unmonitored and monitored regions. Simulations using a river transport model (RTM) forced by a runoff field were used to derive the river mouth outflow from the farthest downstream gauge records. Separate estimates are also made using RTM simulations forced by three different runoff fields: 1) based on observed streamflow and a water balance model, and from estimates of precipitation P minus evaporation E computed as residuals from the atmospheric moisture budget using atmospheric reanalyses from 2) the National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP–NCAR) and 3) the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Compared with previous estimates, improvements are made in extending observed discharge downstream to the river mouth, in accounting for the unmonitored streamflow, in discharging runoff at correct locations, and in providing an annual cycle of continental discharge. The use of river mouth outflow increases the global continental discharge by ∼19\% compared with unadjusted streamflow from the farthest downstream stations. The river-based estimate of global continental discharge presented here is 37 288 ± 662 km3 yr−1, which is ∼7.6\% of global P or 35\% of terrestrial P. While this number is comparable to earlier estimates, its partitioning into individual oceans and its latitudinal distribution differ from earlier studies. The peak discharges into the Arctic, the Pacific, and global oceans occur in June, versus May for the Atlantic and August for the Indian Oceans. Snow accumulation and melt are shown to have large effects on the annual cycle of discharge into all ocean basins except for the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The discharge and its latitudinal distribution implied by the observation-based runoff and the ECMWF reanalysis-based P–E agree well with the river-based estimates, whereas the discharge implied by the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis-based P–E has a negative bias.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to find a combination of optimal numerical algorithms for time-stepping and mode-splitting suitable for a high-resolution, free-surface, terrain-following coordinate oceanic model. Due to mathematical feedback between the baroclinic momentum and tracer equations and, similarly, between the barotropic momentum and continuity equations, it is advantageous to treat both modes so that, after a time step for the momentum equation, the computed velocities participate immediately in the computation of tracers and continuity, and vice versa, rather than advancing all equations for one time step simultaneously. This leads to a new family of time-stepping algorithms that combine forward–backward feedback with the best known synchronous algorithms, allowing an increased time step due to the enhanced internal stability without sacrificing its accuracy. Based on these algorithms we design a split-explicit hydrodynamic kernel for a realistic oceanic model, which addresses multiple numerical issues associated with mode splitting. This kernel utilizes consistent temporal averaging of the barotropic mode via a specially designed filter function to guarantee both exact conservation and constancy preservation properties for tracers and yields more accurate (up to second-order), resolved barotropic processes, while preventing aliasing of unresolved barotropic signals into the slow baroclinic motions. It has a more accurate mode-splitting due to redefined barotropic pressure-gradient terms to account for the local variations in density field, while maintaining the computational efficiency of a split model. It is naturally compatible with a variety of centered and upstream-biased high-order advection algorithms, and helps to mitigate computational cost of expensive physical parameterization of mixing processes and submodels.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the structure and dynamical mechanisms of regional and mesoscale physical variability in the subtropical northeast Pacific Ocean using the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS). The model is configured with a U.S. West Coast domain that spans the California Current System (CCS) with a mesoscale horizontal resolution up to as fine as 3.5 km. Its mean-seasonal forcing is by momentum, heat, and water fluxes at the surface and adaptive nudging to gyre-scale fields at the open water boundaries. Its equilibrium solutions show realistic mean and seasonal states and vigorous mesoscale eddies, fronts, and filaments. The level of eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in the model is comparable to drifter and altimeter estimates in the solutions with sufficiently fine resolution. Because the model lacks nonseasonal transient forcing, the authors conclude that the dominant mesoscale variability in the CCS is intrinsic rather than transiently forced. The primary eddy generation mechanism is the baroclinic instability of upwelling, alongshore currents. There is progressive movement of mean-seasonal currents and eddy energy offshore and downward into the oceanic interior in an annually recurrent cycle. The associated offshore eddy heat fluxes provide the principal balance against nearshore cooling by mean Ekman transport and upwelling. The currents are highly nonuniform along the coast, with important influences by capes and ridges in both maintaining mean standing eddies and launching transient filaments and fronts.},

	abstract = {We study the dynamics of the planktonic ecosystem in the coastal upwelling zone within the California Current System using a three-dimensional (3-D), eddy-resolving circulation model coupled to an ecosystem/biogeochemistry model. The physical model is based on the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS), configured at a resolution of 15km for a domain covering the entire US West Coast, with an embedded child grid covering the central California upwelling region at a resolution of 5km. The model is forced with monthly mean boundary conditions at the open lateral boundaries as well as at the surface. The ecological/biogeochemical model is nitrogen based, includes single classes for phytoplankton and zooplankton, and considers two detrital pools with different sinking speeds. The model also explicitly simulates a variable chlorophyll-to-carbon ratio. Comparisons of model results with either remote sensing observations (AVHRR, SeaWiFS) or in-situ measurements from the CalCOFI program indicate that our model is capable of replicating many of the large-scale, time-averaged features of the coastal upwelling system. An exception is the underestimation of the chlorophyll levels in the northern part of the domain, perhaps because of the lack of short-term variations in the atmospheric forcing. Another shortcoming is that the modeled thermocline is too diffuse, and that the upward slope of the isolines toward the coast is too small. Detailed time-series comparisons with observations from Monterey Bay reveal similar agreements and discrepancies. We attribute the good agreement between the modeled and observed ecological properties in large part to the accuracy of the physical fields. In turn, many of the discrepancies can be traced back to our use of monthly mean forcing. Analysis of the ecosystem structure and dynamics reveal that the magnitude and pattern of phytoplankton biomass in the nearshore region are determined largely by the balance of growth and zooplankton grazing, while in the offshore region, growth is balanced by mortality. The latter appears to be inconsistent with in situ observations and is a result of our consideration of only one zooplankton size class (mesozooplankton), neglecting the importance of microzooplankton grazing in the offshore region. A comparison of the allocation of nitrogen into the different pools of the ecosystem in the 3-D results with those obtained from a box model configuration of the same ecosystem model reveals that only a few components of the ecosystem reach a local steady-state, i.e. where biological sources and sinks balance each other. The balances for the majority of the components are achieved by local biological source and sink terms balancing the net physical divergence, confirming the importance of the 3-D nature of circulation and mixing in a coastal upwelling system.},

	abstract = {We document the configuration and emergent simulation features from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) OM4.0 ocean/sea ice model. OM4 serves as the ocean/sea ice component for the GFDL climate and Earth system models. It is also used for climate science research and is contributing to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 6 Ocean Model Intercomparison Project. The ocean component of OM4 uses version 6 of the Modular Ocean Model and the sea ice component uses version 2 of the Sea Ice Simulator, which have identical horizontal grid layouts (Arakawa C-grid). We follow the Coordinated Ocean-sea ice Reference Experiments protocol to assess simulation quality across a broad suite of climate-relevant features. We present results from two versions differing by horizontal grid spacing and physical parameterizations: OM4p5 has nominal 0.5° spacing and includes mesoscale eddy parameterizations and OM4p25 has nominal 0.25° spacing with no mesoscale eddy parameterization. Modular Ocean Model version 6 makes use of a vertical Lagrangian-remap algorithm that enables general vertical coordinates. We show that use of a hybrid depth-isopycnal coordinate reduces the middepth ocean warming drift commonly found in pure z* vertical coordinate ocean models. To test the need for the mesoscale eddy parameterization used in OM4p5, we examine the results from a simulation that removes the eddy parameterization. The water mass structure and model drift are physically degraded relative to OM4p5, thus supporting the key role for a mesoscale closure at this resolution.},

	abstract = {GLORYS12 is a global eddy-resolving physical ocean and sea ice reanalysis at 1/12° horizontal resolution covering the 1993-present altimetry period, designed and implemented in the framework of the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The model component is the NEMO platform driven at the surface by atmospheric conditions from the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis. Ocean observations are assimilated by means of a reduced-order Kalman filter. Along track altimeter sea level anomaly, satellite sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration, as well as in situ temperature and salinity vertical profiles are jointly assimilated. A 3D-VAR scheme provides an additional correction for the slowly-evolving large-scale biases in temperature and salinity. The performance of the reanalysis shows a clear dependency on the time-dependent in situ observation system. The general assessment of GLORYS12 highlights a level of performance at the state-of-the-art and the capacity of the system to capture the main expected climatic interannual variability signals for ocean and sea ice, the general circulation and the inter-basins exchanges. In terms of trends, GLORYS12 shows a higher than observed warming trend together with a slightly lower than observed global mean sea level rise. Comparisons made with an experiment carried out on the same platform without assimilation show the benefit of data assimilation in controlling water mass properties and sea ice cover and their low frequency variability. Moreover, GLORYS12 represents particularly well the small-scale variability of surface dynamics and compares well with independent (non-assimilated) data. Comparisons made with a twin experiment carried out at 1/4° resolution allows characterizing and quantifying the strengthened contribution of the 1/12° resolution onto the downscaled dynamics. GLORYS12 provides a reliable physical ocean state for climate variability and supports applications such as seasonal forecasts. In addition, this reanalysis has strong assets to serve regional applications and provide relevant physical conditions for applications such as marine biogeochemistry. In the near future, GLORYS12 will be maintained to be as close as possible to real time and could therefore provide relevant and continuous reference past ocean states for many operational applications.},

In this study, we introduce a new initialized prediction system using the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) that is specifically designed to probe potential and actual prediction skill at lead times ranging from 1 month out to 2 years. The Seasonal-to-Multiyear Large Ensemble (SMYLE) consists of a collection of 2-year-long hindcast simulations, with four initializations per year from 1970 to 2019 and an ensemble size of 20. A full suite of output is available for exploring near-term predictability of all Earth system components represented in CESM2. We show that SMYLE skill for El Niño–Southern Oscillation is competitive with other prominent seasonal prediction systems, with correlations exceeding 0.5 beyond a lead time of 12 months. A broad overview of prediction skill reveals varying degrees of potential for useful multiyear predictions of seasonal anomalies in the atmosphere, ocean, land, and sea ice. The SMYLE dataset, experimental design, model, initial conditions, and associated analysis tools are all publicly available, providing a foundation for research on multiyear prediction of environmental change by the wider community.},

The quality-controlled and internally consistent GLODAPv2 was used to create global 1° × 1° mapped climatologies of salinity, temperature, oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, silicate, total dissolved inorganic carbon (TCO$_{\textrm{2}}$), total alkalinity (TAlk), pH, and CaCO$_{\textrm{3}}$ saturation states using the Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis (DIVA) mapping method. Improving on maps based on an earlier but similar dataset, GLODAPv1.1, this climatology also covers the Arctic Ocean. Climatologies were created for 33 standard depth surfaces. The conceivably confounding temporal trends in TCO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and pH due to anthropogenic influence were removed prior to mapping by normalizing these data to the year 2002 using first-order calculations of anthropogenic carbon accumulation rates. We additionally provide maps of accumulated anthropogenic carbon in the year 2002 and of preindustrial TCO$_{\textrm{2}}$. For all parameters, all data from the full 1972–2013 period were used, including data that did not receive full secondary quality control.

	abstract = {Even though desert dust is the most abundant aerosol by mass in Earth's atmosphere, atmospheric models struggle to accurately represent its spatial and temporal distribution. These model errors are partially caused by fundamental difficulties in simulating dust emission in coarse-resolution models and in accurately representing dust microphysical properties. Here we mitigate these problems by developing a new methodology that yields an improved representation of the global dust cycle. We present an analytical framework that uses inverse modeling to integrate an ensemble of global model simulations with observational constraints on the dust size distribution, extinction efficiency, and regional dust aerosol optical depth. We then compare the inverse model results against independent measurements of dust surface concentration and deposition flux and find that errors are reduced by approximately a factor of 2 relative to current model simulations of the Northern Hemisphere dust cycle. The inverse model results show smaller improvements in the less dusty Southern Hemisphere, most likely because both the model simulations and the observational constraints used in the inverse model are less accurate. On a global basis, we find that the emission flux of dust with a geometric diameter up to 20 µm (PM20) is approximately 5000 Tg yr−1, which is greater than most models account for. This larger PM20 dust flux is needed to match observational constraints showing a large atmospheric loading of coarse dust. We obtain gridded datasets of dust emission, vertically integrated loading, dust aerosol optical depth, (surface) concentration, and wet and dry deposition fluxes that are resolved by season and particle size. As our results indicate that this dataset is more accurate than current model simulations and the MERRA-2 dust reanalysis product, it can be used to improve quantifications of dust impacts on the Earth system.},

Industrial and vehicular pollution, wildfires, volcanoes, biogenic debris, and desert dust all carry nutrients within their plumes throughout the globe. In remote ocean ecosystems, aerosol deposition represents an essential new source of nutrients for primary production. The large spatiotemporal variability in aerosols from myriad sources combined with the differential responses of marine biota to changing fluxes makes it crucially important to understand where, when, and how much nutrients from the atmosphere enter marine ecosystems. This review brings together existing literature, experimental evidence of impacts, and new atmospheric nutrient observations that can be compared with atmospheric and ocean biogeochemistry modeling. We evaluate the contribution and spatiotemporal variability of nutrient-bearing aerosols from desert dust, wildfire, volcanic, and anthropogenic sources, including the organic component, deposition fluxes, and oceanic impacts.},

	abstract = {The importance of dissolved Fe (dFe) in regulating ocean primary production and the carbon cycle is well established. However, the large-scale distribution and temporal dynamics of dFe remain poorly constrained in part due to incomplete observational coverage. In this study, we use a compilation of published dFe observations (n=32,344) with paired environmental predictors from contemporaneous satellite observations and reanalysis products to build a data-driven surface-to-seafloor dFe climatology with 1°×1° resolution using three machine-learning approaches (random forest, supper vector machine and artificial neural network). Among the three approaches, random forest achieves the highest accuracy with overall R2 and root mean standard error of 0.8 and 0.3 nmol L-1, respectively. Using this data-driven climatology, we explore the possible mechanisms governing the dFe distribution at various depth horizons using statistical metrics such as Pearson correlation coefficients and the rank of predictors importance in the model construction. Our results are consistent with the critical role of aeolian iron supply in enriching surface dFe in the low latitude regions and suggest a far-reaching impact of this source at depth. Away from the surface layer, the strong correlation between dFe and apparent oxygen utilization implies that a combination of regeneration, scavenging and large-scale ocean circulation are controlling the interior distribution of dFe, with hydrothermal inputs important in some regions. Finally, our data-driven dFe climatology can be used as an alternative reference to evaluate the performance of ocean biogeochemical models. Overall, the new global scale climatology of dFe achieved in our study is an important step toward improved representation of dFe in the contemporary ocean and may also be used to guide future sampling strategies.},
